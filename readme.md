### Links

- Live Site URL: [Site]

## My process

1. I started up planning and writing up the HTML
2. Wrote the css styles
3. Added media queries and responsiveness

At the moment, there was no need to add much Javascript but there will be more functionality in the future

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- Media queries

### What I learned

The interesting part for me was to build layout with 2 column parts. One side is image and the other is content. Used a lot of fixed and absolute positioning.

- Building Mobile navigation

Mobile navigation is always interesting to build as you progress and learn new ways.

```css
.container-img {
background: linear-gradient(
    180deg,
    rgba(7, 7, 7, 0.96) 0%,
    rgba(196, 196, 196, 0) 100%
  ),
  url("assets/Gradient\ Blog\ Post\ Instagram\ Story.jpg") no-repeat center
    center / cover;
background-position: center;
object-fit: cover;

.heading-tertiary {
  background: -webkit-linear-gradient(
    180deg,
    #ffad33 0%,
    #d51b74 56.25%,
    #b607a4 100%
  );
}
```

### Continued development

Next step would be to improve the html and css code.
There is much to improve in CSS part and to add more javascript functionality.
